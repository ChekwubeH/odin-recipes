        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            While it may sound like a plain generic item you see on
            a menu at the food court at the mall, honey-garlic shrimp
            is actually one of the most exciting and delicious garlic
            shrimp recipes. It's the perfect balance of sweet and
            savory while still packing a substantial garlic punch,
            plus it's extremely fast and simple to make. This recipe 
            uses half the honey that typical recipes use and allows the
            natural sweetness of the shrimp to shine through. Serve
            over hot cooked rice or the starchy base of your choice
            such as noodles.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound large raw shrimp (16-20 count), peeled and 
                deveined</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced green onion, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure shrimp are fully thawed and well drained. Keep in
                the refrigerator while you make the marinade.</li>
            <li>Whisk garlic, honey, ginger, soy sauce, and fish sauce
                together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add shrimp and toss thoroghly with a spatula for 2 minutes
                until completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate
                in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes; toss occasionally
                while marinating.</li>
            <li>Brush a large nonstick skillet with oil and heat over high heat
                until you begin to see small wisps of smoke. Use tongs to
                immediately transfer shrimp into the hot skillet in a single layer.
                Set excess marinade aside.
            </li>
            <li>Sear shrimp for 2 minutes, then flip over. Dump in marinade and
                cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat and flip shrimp once more; let
                sit for about 1 minute. The marinade in the pan will reduce down
                to a beautiful glaze just from the residual heat in the pan,
                Garnish with green onion.</li>
        </ol>
